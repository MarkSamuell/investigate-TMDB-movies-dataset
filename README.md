The project uses Python to explore the dataset. The following steps are taken:

1. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. The DataFrame is explored using basic Python and Pandas commands.
3. The DataFrame is visualized using Matplotlib.

The project concludes with a discussion of the findings.
